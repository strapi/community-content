## Starters

Do you want to create your own e-commerce starter with Strapi and Svelte and share it with the community?
It is totally possible for you to submit your starter using our official templates:

   - E-commerce: https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-ecommerce
   - Corporate: https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-corporate
   - Blog: https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-blog
   - Portfolio: https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-portfolio

A template is a Strapi project containing existing content-types and data.
A starter is a front-end project ready to fetch a Strapi template project data.

## Showcase

Show to the community what your project looks like

The entire Strapi team is very curious to see what you guy's can build using our product and it may be the same for people in the community who want to reassure themselves about what we can create with Strapi.

We decided to create a [Showcase](https://github.com/strapi/community-content/tree/master/showcase) section where anyone can list his site that has been made with love, and Strapi of course! This list will be displayed on our website soon.
